Introduction

This project focuses on applying EKF and UKF to estimate the position of a robot, represented by a non-linear model. The robot is equipped with a speed sensor, a gyroscope, and a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) sensor. By fusing the data from these sensors, the filters aim to provide accurate localization of the robot.
