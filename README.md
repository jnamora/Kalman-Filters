This project focuses on applying Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to benchmark the estimated positions of a robot, represented by a non-linear model. The robot is equipped with a speed sensor, a gyroscope, and a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) sensor. By fusing the data from these sensors, the filters aim to provide accurate localization of the robot.
